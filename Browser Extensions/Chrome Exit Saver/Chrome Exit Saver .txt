Chrome Exit Saver 

This Chrome extension is designed to prevent the accidental closure of the browser when only a single tab is open by prompting the user with a confirmation dialog. The primary goal is to safeguard users from inadvertently losing their work or the context of their current task due to a misclick or habitual closing of the browser. When the user attempts to close the last remaining tab in Chrome, the extension detects this action and displays a standard browser confirmation popup, asking the user to confirm their intention to close the tab. This added step serves as a safety net, ensuring that users have a moment to reconsider their action and potentially avoid the unintended closure of important tabs.

async function checkLastTab() {
  let queryOptions = { currentWindow: true };
  let tabs = await chrome.tabs.query(queryOptions);

  if (tabs.length === 1) {
    let confirmClose = confirm("Are you sure you want to close the last tab?");
    if (!confirmClose) {
      // Prevent tab closure (Note: This might not be fully effective due to browser security restrictions)
      chrome.tabs.create({}); // Create a new tab to prevent the window from closing
    }
  }
}

Integrating this feature directly into Chrome would enhance the user experience by offering a built-in layer of protection against accidental tab closure, especially when working with crucial information or during intensive research sessions. This would eliminate the need for external extensions, ensuring a seamless and more secure browsing experience for all users. By providing users with a native option to enable or disable this confirmation prompt based on their preferences, Chrome could cater to a wider audience, accommodating those who value this safeguard while maintaining efficiency for users who prefer uninterrupted browsing. Such a feature would reflect Chrome's commitment to user-centric design, prioritizing not just speed and efficiency but also the prevention of potential disruptions in the user's workflow.
